# Welcome to my Portfolio Website
Here you can find all you need to know about work I've done and can take a look at the source code which powers it.

## About Me
I design and make pixels for people to click on the internet.
I'm a trained engineer so I am very methodical and analytical. I believe in Test Driven Development to deliver maintainable software for increased user experience (UX).
I am a self-taught developer who started with Python to create automation scripts, but moved to Javascript to learn web development.
I'm eager to learn new frameworks and technologies to improve my skills and help make a brighter future.
