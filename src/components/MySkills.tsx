      <h2>My Skills</h2>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught developer so Iâ€™m continuously looking to improve and gain knowledge to better myself. I develop using best practices in Clean Coding and Version Control.
        <br /> <br />
        I primarily use ReactJS with TypeScript for my core frontend frameworks. For CSS I use TailwindCSS to create custom components.
        <br /> <br />
        I have experience in serverside languages such as Python and NodeJS, I have used these to develop quick programs. I also have experience in web-scraping using Pupetteer and Playwright.
