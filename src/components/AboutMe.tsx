      <p>
        Hi, I am an aspiring full-stack engineer proactive to learn new technologies and development methodologies. I have specialised in front-end development for 2 years but have great experience with server-side languages and practices.
        <br /><br />
        Iâ€™m excited to learn new technologies such as Vue, Svelte and NextJS.
        <br /><br />
        Oh and I love tennis, sim-racing and Formula 1.
      </p>
    </div>
