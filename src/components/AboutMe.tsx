      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I am an aspiring full-stack engineer proactive to learn new technologies and development methodologies. I have specialised in front-end development for 2 years but have great experience with server-side languages and practices, along with involvement within DevOps projects.
        <br /><br />
        I'm excited to learn new things and embrace new opportunities. I like to help others and develop new talent, as I believe this is one of the best ways to develop yourself.
        <br /><br />
        Oh and I love tennis, sim-racing and Formula 1.
